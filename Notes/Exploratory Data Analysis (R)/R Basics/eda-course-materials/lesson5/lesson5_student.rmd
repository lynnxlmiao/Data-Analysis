### Third Qualitative Variable

```{r}
#Load data of pseudo_facebook
library(ggplot2)
pf <- read.csv('C:/Files/Udacity/Data-Analysis/Notes/Exploratory Data Analysis (R)/R Basics/eda-course-materials/lesson3/pseudo_facebook.tsv', sep = '\t')
#sep="\t" tells R that the file is tab-delimited (use " " for space delimited and "," for comma delimited; use "," for a .csv file)
```


```{r Third Qualitative Variable}
ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = age),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender))) + geom_boxplot() +
  #add the mean for each gender to the box plots, using stat summary
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = 'point', shape = 4)
  #the averages marked by an x since shape = 4
```

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender))) +
  geom_line(aes(color = gender), stat = 'summary', fun.y = median)
```

```{r}
# Write code to create a new data frame,
# called 'pf.fc_by_age_gender', that contains
# information on each age AND gender group.

# The data frame should contain the following variables:

#    mean_friend_count,
#    median_friend_count,
#    n (the number of users in each age and gender grouping)

# Here is an example of the structure of your data frame. Your
# data values will be different. Note that if you are grouping by
# more than one variable, you will probably need to call the
# ungroup() function. 

#   age gender mean_friend_count median_friend_count    n
# 1  13 female          247.2953                 150  207
# 2  13   male          184.2342                  61  265
# 3  14 female          329.1938                 245  834
# 4  14   male          157.1204                  88 1201
