### Scatterplot Review

```{r Scatterplot Review}
# Let's start by examining two variables in the data set.
# The scatterplot is a powerful tool to help you understand
# the relationship between two continuous variables.

# We can quickly see if the relationship is linear or not.
# In this case, we can use a variety of diamond
# characteristics to help us figure out whether
# the price advertised for any given diamond is 
# reasonable or a rip-off.

# Let's consider the price of a diamond and it's carat weight.
# Create a scatterplot of price (y) vs carat weight (x).

# Limit the x-axis and y-axis to omit the top 1% of values.

qplot(data = diamonds, x = carat, y = price,
      xlim = c(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99)),
      ylim = c(0, quantile(diamonds$price, 0.99))) +
  geom_point(fill = I('#F79420'), color = I('black'), shape = 21)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(color = '#F79420', alpha = 1/4) +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99))) +
  scale_y_continuous(lim = c(0, quantile(diamonds$price, 0.99)))
```

### Price and Carat Relationship
Response:
A nonlinear relationship. Maybe it's exponential. Also the dispersion or variance or the relationship also increase as carat size increases.

### ggpairs Function
Notes:
```{r}
# install these if necessary
install.packages('GGally')  #particular plot 
install.packages('scales')  #for a variety of things
install.packages('memisc')  #summarize the regression
install.packages('lattice') #few other things
install.packages('MASS')    #various functions
install.packages('car')     #recode variables
install.packages('reshape') #reshape and wrangle data
install.packages('dplyr')   #create summaries and transmissions
```

```{r}
# load the ggplot graphics package and the others
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(scales)
library(memisc)
```

```{r ggpairs Function}
# sample 10,000 diamonds from the data set
set.seed(20022012)
diamond_samp <- diamonds[sample(1:length(diamonds$price), 10000), ]
ggpairs(diamond_samp, params = c(shape = I('.'), outlier.shape = I('.')))
```

What are some things you notice in the ggpairs output?
Response:
There may be relationships between price and clarity and price and color.
And the critical factor dribing price is the size, or the carat weight of the diamond, it is nonlinear, even exponential.

### The Demand of Diamonds
Notes:

```{r The Demand of Diamonds}
# Create two histograms of the price variable
# and place them side by side on one output image.

# We've put some code below to get you started.

# The first plot should be a histogram of price
# and the second plot should transform
# the price variable using log10.

# Set appropriate bin widths for each plot.
# ggtitle() will add a title to each histogram.

library(gridExtra)

plot1 <- qplot(data = diamonds, x = price, binwidth = 100, fill = I('#0990D9')) + 
  ggtitle('Price')

plot2 <- qplot(data = diamonds, x = price, binwidth = 0.01, fill = I('#F79420')) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10)') +
  scale_x_log10()

library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol = 2)
```

***

### Connecting Demand and Price Distributions
Notes:
The price of diamonds are pretty heavily skewed, but when add price log function, it is much like a normal distribution, and can even see a little bit of bimodality on the log plot. 
***

### Scatterplot Transformation

```{r Scatterplot Transformation}
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans()) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Carat')
```


### Create a new function to transform the carat variable

```{r cuberoot transformation}
cuberoot_trans = function() trans_new('cuberoot', transform = function(x) x^(1/3),
                                      inverse = function(x) x^3)
```

#### Use the cuberoot_trans function
```{r Use cuberoot_trans}
ggplot(aes(carat, price), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
                     breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
                     breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Cube-Root of Carat')
```

***

### Overplotting Revisited

```{r Sort and Head Tables}
head(sort(table(diamonds$carat), decreasing = T))
head(sort(table(diamonds$price), decreasing = T))
```


```{r Overplotting Revisited}
# Add a layer to adjust the features of the
# scatterplot. Set the transparency to one half,
# the size to three-fourths, and jitter the points.

ggplot(aes(carat, price), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 0.75, position = 'jitter') + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
                     breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
                     breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Cube-Root of Carat')
```

### Other Qualitative Factors

### Price vs. Carat and Clarity

Alter the code below.

```{r}
# install and load the RColorBrewer package
install.packages('RColorBrewer', dependencies = TRUE)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

```{r Price vs. Carat and Clarity}
# Adjust the code below to color the points by clarity.

# A layer called scale_color_brewer() has 
# been added to adjust the legend and
# provide custom colors.
library(scales)

ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = clarity), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1, position = 'jitter') +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
    guide = guide_legend(title = 'Clarity', reverse = T,
    override.aes = list(alpha = 1, size = 2))) +  
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
    breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
    breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +

  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Clarity', reverse = T,
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, size = 2))) +

### Price vs. Carat and Color

Alter the code below.
```{r Price vs. Carat and Color}
ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1, position = 'jitter') +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
                     guide = guide_legend(title = Cut, reverse = T,

### Linear Models in R

### Building the Linear Model
Notes:

```{r Building the Linear Model}
m1 <- lm(I(log(price)) ~ I(carat^(1/3)), data = diamonds)
m2 <- update(m1, ~ . + carat)
m3 <- update(m2, ~ . + cut)
m4 <- update(m3, ~ . + color)
m5 <- update(m4, ~ . + clarity)
mtable(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5)
```

Notice how adding cut to our model does not help explain much of the variance
in the price of diamonds. This fits with out exploration earlier.

### Model Problems
Video Notes:

Research:
(Take some time to come up with 2-4 problems for the model)
(You should 10-20 min on this)

### A Bigger, Better Data Set
Notes:

```{r A Bigger, Better Data Set}
install.package('bitops')
install.packages('RCurl')
library('bitops')
library('RCurl')

diamondsurl = getBinaryURL("https://raw.github.com/solomonm/diamonds-data/master/BigDiamonds.Rda")
load(rawConnection(diamondsurl))
```

The code used to obtain the data is available here:

## Building a Model Using the Big Diamonds Data Set
Notes:

```{r Building a Model Using the Big Diamonds Data Set}

```

## Predictions

Example Diamond from BlueNile:
Round 1.00 Very Good I VS1 $5,601

```{r}
#Be sure youâ€™ve loaded the library memisc and have m5 saved as an object in your workspace.
thisDiamond = data.frame(carat = 1.00, cut = "V.Good",
                         color = "I", clarity="VS1")
modelEstimate = predict(m5, newdata = thisDiamond,
                        interval="prediction", level = .95)
```

Evaluate how well the model predicts the BlueNile diamond's price. Think about the fitted point estimate as well as the 95% CI.
