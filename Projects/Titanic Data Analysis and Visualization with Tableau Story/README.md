## Titanic Data Analysis and Visualization with Tableau ##
Technologies involved: Python, Tableau, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

This project is to use data wrangling techniques to process titanic data from Kaggle Titanic Competition, and used NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib to explore the factors that made people more likely to survive.
+ Did the chance of survival depend on Sex?
+ Did one's ticket class realted to the chance of survival?
+ Did Age influence one's chance of survival?

And a Tableau Story is created which contains demographics and passengers information and revealed the higher survival chance factors.

+ Female passengers had higher chance of survival

+ Passengers of first class had higher chance of survival

+ Passengers below 10 years old had higher chance of survival, while it looks like age didn't play any role for adults of survival

+ To conclude, female passengers of first class had the highest possibility of surviving
