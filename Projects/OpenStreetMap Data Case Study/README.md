## WRANGLE OPENSTREETMAP DATA ##
Technologies involved: Python, SQL, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Verification,
Data Cleaning, etc.

OpenStreetMap (OSM)is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Created by Steve Coast in the UK in 2004, it was inspired by the success of Wikipedia and the predominance of proprietary map data in the UK and elsewhere. Since then, it has grown to over 2 million registered users, who can collect data using manual survey, GPS devices, aerial photography, and other free sources. This crowdsourced data is then made available under the Open Database Licence. 

This project has clean the data of Portland, Oregon, U.S from OpenStreetMap (in XML format) with data munging techniques, addressing problems such as abbreviated and inconsistent information and then explore data with SQL.
