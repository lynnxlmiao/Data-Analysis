## Bay Area Bike Share Analysis ##
Technologies involved: Python, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, etc.


Bay Area Bike Share is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees.

In 2014, Bay Area Bike Share held an Open Data Challenge to encourage data analysts to create visualizations based on their open data set. This project has performed an exploratory analysis on the data after some data wrangling techniques, to determine the differences in usage between commuters and tourists' ridership patterns, average duration of trips, etc.
