## IDENTIFY FRAUD FROM ENRON EMAIL ##
Technologies involved: Python, scikit-learn, Machine Learning, Feature Selection, Model Evaluation and Validation, etc.

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to sidespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. This project has built a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal.

+ Algorithm selection
Naive bayes was the best algorithm in this case after trying naive bayes, k-mean, svm and logistic regression. Because it maximize both accuracy, precision and recall from the result below.
